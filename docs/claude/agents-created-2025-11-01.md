# Agent Creation Summary — 2025-11-01

## Summary
Created two custom Claude agents for Revline code quality enforcement, following CLAUDE.md workflow principles.

## Files Created

### 1. `.claude/agents/type-safety-enforcer.md`
**Purpose**: Audit TypeScript strict mode compliance across frontend codebase

**Core Capabilities**:
- Detects implicit `any` usage
- Validates typed API responses
- Checks React Query hook types (`UseQueryResult<Data, AppError>`)
- Identifies unsafe type assertions (`as any`, `@ts-ignore`)
- Enforces strict null checking patterns

**Usage**:
```bash
claude "Run type-safety-enforcer agent on frontend"
```

**Output**: Generates `suggested-changes.md` with violations categorized by severity (Critical → Warning → Info)

---

### 2. `.claude/agents/api-layer-validator.md`
**Purpose**: Ensure all network calls use unified `api.get`/`api.post` layer

**Core Capabilities**:
- Detects direct `fetch()` or `axios()` bypassing API client
- Validates all API calls specify generic types
- Checks React Query integration with `AppQueryProvider`
- Enforces consistent `AppError` error handling
- Audits auth flow (token refresh, 401/403 handling)

**Usage**:
```bash
claude "Run api-layer-validator agent on frontend"
```

**Output**: Generates `suggested-changes.md` with unified diff-style fixes

---

### 3. `.claude/agents/README.md`
**Purpose**: Documentation hub for all Revline agents

**Contents**:
- Agent catalog with invocation instructions
- Workflow integration with CLAUDE.md
- Template for creating new agents
- Quality gate checklist
- Roadmap for future agents (Phase 2: feature-scaffolder, sprint-reviewer)

---

## Reasoning

### Why These Two Agents First?
1. **type-safety-enforcer** — Aligns with Revline's "Type Safety First" principle in CLAUDE.md
2. **api-layer-validator** — Enforces "Unified API Layer" architecture requirement

Both agents address the most critical architectural patterns in the project.

### Design Decisions
- **No Auto-Execution**: Agents output to `suggested-changes.md`, never auto-commit (per CLAUDE.md)
- **Diff-Style Output**: Uses unified diff format for clarity
- **Reasoning Required**: Every change includes "why" explanation
- **Questions for Maintainers**: Agents ask instead of assuming design intent
- **Success Criteria**: Each agent defines validation steps (`npm run type-check`, etc.)

---

## Next Steps for Maintainers

### 1. Test Drive an Agent
```bash
# From repo root
claude "Run type-safety-enforcer agent on frontend/src/features/ros"
```

Review the generated `suggested-changes.md` and provide feedback on:
- Are the violations accurate?
- Is the output format helpful?
- Are the proposed fixes aligned with team standards?

### 2. Refine Agent Definitions
Based on testing, adjust:
- Severity thresholds (what's critical vs. warning?)
- Code patterns to ignore (e.g., `any` in test files?)
- Output verbosity

### 3. Create Next Agents (Phase 2)
When ready, add:
- **feature-scaffolder** — Generate boilerplate for new features
- **sprint-reviewer** — Pre-merge quality gate automation

### 4. Optional: Archive Historical Outputs
```bash
# Move old suggested-changes.md to docs
mv suggested-changes.md docs/claude/seeding-fixes-2025-11-01.md
```

## Questions for Atlas/Peter

### Agent Scope
1. Should **type-safety-enforcer** flag `any` in test files, or only production code?
2. Should **api-layer-validator** enforce retry logic for 5xx errors, or leave that flexible?

### Output Format
3. Is the diff-style format in `suggested-changes.md` readable, or prefer side-by-side?
4. Should agents create separate files per run, or append to existing `suggested-changes.md`?

### Workflow Integration
5. Should agents run automatically in CI, or only on-demand during dev?
6. Do you want a GitHub Action that comments agent findings on PRs?

## Validation Checklist

Before accepting this proposal, verify:

- [ ] `.claude/agents/type-safety-enforcer.md` follows template structure
- [ ] `.claude/agents/api-layer-validator.md` includes concrete examples
- [ ] `.claude/agents/README.md` clearly explains usage
- [ ] Agent definitions align with CLAUDE.md principles (no auto-commit, etc.)
- [ ] Test an agent on real codebase to validate output quality

---

## Example Usage Session

```bash
# 1. Run type safety audit
claude "Run type-safety-enforcer agent on frontend"

# 2. Review suggested-changes.md
cat suggested-changes.md

# 3. Apply fixes manually (or with patch)
# Edit files based on diffs

# 4. Validate fixes
cd frontend
npm run type-check  # Should pass ✅
npm run lint        # Should pass ✅

# 5. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix(types): address type-safety-enforcer findings"
```

## Files Modified

**New files**:
- `.claude/agents/type-safety-enforcer.md`
- `.claude/agents/api-layer-validator.md`
- `.claude/agents/README.md`
- `docs/claude/agents-created-2025-11-01.md` (this file)

**No existing files modified** — agents are purely additive.
